# This is my Bid site for the ReactJs course
## My name is Viktor Hristov and this is my project:

- ## First we need to start the server - cd server

## npm install to install all the dependancies
npm start if you want it without nodemon, if you want nodemon - npm run dev

- ## Then we go to client with cd client and we npm install all the dependancies

## After we have started all things here is a brief description of the site

- ## There are public and private parts as required the public are the main page, the create and details page, if you want to create you need to register or login first, there are no premade users

- ## After we create something we can view it and edit or delete if we want and nobody has bidded on it

- ### The bidding is available to people who are logged and haven't bidded yet, they can only bid one time, the last bidder is the winner, even though they don't win because there is no time limit

- To bid just click the button "Bid" and a mini form will appear, there just type the money you want to bid and the new price will update as well it will say thay you are the winner

- ## The last dynamic page is the profile, where you can see you image, name, email, number of posts and the picture of the thing you have created, if clicked it goes directly to the details of the product
